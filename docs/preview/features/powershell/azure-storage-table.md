# Azure storage account context has been retrieved
# Azure storage table 'products' does not exist yet in the Azure storage account, so will create one
# Azure storage table 'products' created
```

With existing table and re-create:

```powershell
PS> Create-AzStorageTable -ResourceGroupName "stock" -StorageAccountName "admin" -TableName "products" -Recreate -RetryIntervalSeconds 3

# Azure storage table 'products' has been removed
# Failed to re-create the Azure storage table 'products', retrying in 5 seconds...
# Failed to re-create the Azure storage table 'products', retrying in 5 seconds...
# Azure storage table 'products' created
```
