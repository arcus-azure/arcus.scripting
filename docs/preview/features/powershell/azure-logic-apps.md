- [Disabling Azure Logic Apps from configuration file](#disabling-azure-logic-apps-from-configuration-file)

## Installation

To have access to the following features, you have to import the module:

```powershell
PS> Import-Module -Name Arcus.Scripting.LogicApps
```

## Disabling Azure Logic Apps from configuration file

Typically done the first task of the release pipeline, right before the deployment of the Logic Apps, will disable all specified Logic Apps in a specific order. 
The Azure Logic Apps to be disabled and the order in which this will be done, will be defined in the provided configuration file.
The order of the Azure Logic Apps in the configuration file (bottom to top) defines the order in which they will be disabled by the script. The counterpart of this script used to enable the Azure Logic Apps, will take the order as specified (top to bottom) in the file.

| Parameter         | Mandatory | Description                                                                                                         |
| ----------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ResourceGroupName | yes       | The resource group containing the Azure Logic Apps.                                                                 |
| DeployFileName    | no        | If your solution consists of multiple interfaces, you can specify the flow-specific name of the configuration file. |

The schema of this configuration file is a JSON structure of an array with the following inputs:

| Node        | Type            | Description                                                                                                           |
| ----------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Description | `string`        | Description of Azure Logic App set to disable.                                                                        |
| CheckType   | `enum`          | `None`: don't perform any additional checks. |
|             |                 | `NoWaitingOrRunningRuns`: waits until there are no more waiting or running Logic App instances. |
| StopType    | `enum`          | `None`: don't disable to given Logic Apps. |
|             |                 | `Immediate`: disable the given Logic Apps. |
| LogicApps   | `string array`  | Set of Logic App names to disable.                                                                                    |

**Example**

Taking an example in which a set of Azure Logic Apps (`"rcv-shopping-order-*"`) need to be disabled, the following configuration will not take into account any active Logic Apps runs (`checkType = None`) and will immediately disable them (`stopType = Immediate`), starting with the _receive protocol_ instances and working its way up to the _sender_ Logic App.

```json
[
  {
    "description": "Sender(s)",
    "checkType": "None",
    "stopType": "Immediate",
    "logicApps": [
      "snd-shopping-order-confirmation-smtp"
    ]
  },
  {
    "description": "Orchestrator(s)",
    "checkType": "None",
    "stopType": "Immediate",
    "logicApps": [
      "orc-shopping-order-processing"
    ]
  },
  {
    "description": "Generic Receiver(s)",
    "checkType": "None",
    "stopType": "Immediate",
    "logicApps": [
      "rcv-shopping-order"
    ]
  },
  {
    "description": "Protocol Receiver(s)",
    "checkType": "None",
    "stopType": "Immediate",
    "logicApps": [
      "rcv-shopping-order-ftp",
      "rcv-shopping-order-sftp",
      "rcv-shopping-order-file"
    ]
  }
]
```

**Example**

Disables all the Logic Apps based on the `./deploy-orderControl.json` configuration file.
Uses the sample configuration file here above.

```powershell
PS> Disable-AzLogicAppsFromConfig -DeployFilename "./deploy-orderControl" -ResourceGroupName "my-resource-group"
# Executing batch: Protocol Receiver(s)
# ==========================
# > Executing CheckType 'None' for batch 'Protocol Receiver(s)' in resource group 'my-resource-group'"
# Executing Check 'None' => peforming no check and executing stopType

# > Executing StopType 'None' for Logic App 'rcv-shopping-order-ftp' in resource group 'my-resource-group'
# Attempting to disable rcv-shopping-order-ftp
# Successfully disabled rcv-shopping-order-ftp

# > Executing StopType 'None' for Logic App 'rcv-shopping-order-sftp' in resource group 'my-resource-group'
# Attempting to disable rcv-shopping-order-sftp
# Successfully disabled rcv-shopping-order-sftp

# > Executing StopType 'None' for Logic App 'rcv-shopping-order-file' in resource group 'my-resource-group'
# Attempting to disable rcv-shopping-order-file
# Successfully disabled rcv-shopping-order-file

# > Executing StopType 'None' for Logic App 'rcv-shopping-order' in resource group 'my-resource-group'
# Attempting to disable rcv-shopping-order
# Successfully disabled rcv-shopping-order

# > Executing StopType 'None' for Logic App 'orc-shopping-order-processing' in resource group 'my-resource-group'
# Attempting to disable orc-shopping-order-processing
# Successfully disabled orc-shopping-order-processing

# > Executing StopType 'None' for Logic App 'snd-shopping-order-confirmation-smtp' in resource group 'my-resource-group'
# Attempting to disable snd-shopping-order-confirmation-smtp
# Successfully disabled snd-shopping-order-confirmation-smtp

# -> Batch: 'Protocol Receiver(s)' has been executed
